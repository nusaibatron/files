// Write a function that accepts three integer arrays (each array will be sorted in ascending order), 
// then find and return the smallest number that is common in all three arrays. 
// Return false if there is no common smallest number.

// Solution by Nusaiba Rahman

function smallest_common_int(l1, l2, l3) {

// This interger will compare other integers and only update if they're smaller.
// It is itialized to MAX_INT becuase the first comparision will definitley be smaller than 
// the MAX_INT, and if it's not, this will symbolize something else later explained in the code
var currMin = Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER

// In my solution, the reason we cannot stop after the 
// first common found integer (given that the lists are ascending, this might seem intuitive)
// is becuase we don't know the ascending order the l1, l2, l3 parameters will be given in

//This loop is for checking integers only seen in all three arrays
for (index = 0; index<l1.length; index++) {
	if (l2.includes(l1[index]) && l3.includes(l1[index])) {

		// Once a common integer is found, currMin will be updated or kept
		// the same depending on if the found one was smaller
		currMin = Math.min(currMin, l1[index])
	}
}

// If the MAXINT was never changed, that means no common integers were found 
// (since any minimum comparision of an interger would have resulted in this being changed)
// and as the spec states, it should return False 
	if (currMin === Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER ) {
  		return "False"
}

// This returns the final common interger that was not larger than any others 
  return currMin

}

// Below are some test arrays as well as what the functions should and correctly does output
